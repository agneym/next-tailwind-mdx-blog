So I have been dating this girl for few months, going well, met each other’s parents and so on. Christmas coming and we decide to give gifts, she warns me though that in her family first Christmas present is often involved with banter or some joke.

As I love banter and pranks as much as her I immediately pick up on this! Then one night we are talking about how she has never been in a relationship and she says in a joke she is basically in training. That’s it, I get an idea for a prank gift! Go online and order it.

Fast forward yesterday, things don’t always as planned and in a nice civil way I got dumped right before Christmas. Yesterday was also a rough day at work so a pretty hard bad day overall. So I woke up this morning ready to start working from home due to COVID. Still little bummed about things ending but today must be better.

# Second Blog Post

Let me start with saying initial. And some Lorem Ipsum.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris nibh diam, bibendum at libero sed, pellentesque blandit quam. Cras quis risus scelerisque, finibus velit a, sollicitudin magna. Aenean ac ipsum a dolor pulvinar porttitor. Nulla rutrum lobortis mauris, at volutpat sem pretium vel. Nunc dapibus tellus eros, sit amet euismod ante pellentesque id. Donec non lacinia lacus. Nullam ultricies nisi quis magna lobortis facilisis.
